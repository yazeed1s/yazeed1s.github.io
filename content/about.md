### About Me

#### OS

I’ve always leaned toward Unix-based systems. I started on macOS, tried Ubuntu (didn’t like the package manager or Flatpak split), ruled out vanilla Debian for being too slow-moving, and eventually landed on Arch Linux.

For some reason, people love to glorify Arch users. Personally, I think that’s a bit silly. Arch isn’t hard to use or maintain anymore, and it’s nowhere near as fragile as some folks make it out to be. I’ve been daily driving it for about 4 years now, and it hasn’t broken on me once. Installing, using, and maintaining it is pretty straightforward as the Arch Wiki has literally everything detailed out for you.

Also, arch is super custmizable, you get to feel the joy of building and configuring your own system and eventaully have your own DE built for you. And The AUR and pacman are fantastic, really, I can confidently run `pacman/yay -S [package name]` and find what I’m looking for. I’ve got both an LTS kernel and a rolling kernel installed, and I can switch between them just in case one decides to misbehave (though that hasn’t happened yet).

#### Window manager

I’m still on X11. I started with bspwm and used it for years, but these days I run my own tiling window manager. Wrote it in C with a BSP tree. It’s opinionated, sure, but it fits how I work perfectly
