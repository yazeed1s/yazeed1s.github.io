# Hi, I'm Yazeed.

Master's student in Computer Science at Virginia Tech. I work on systems stuff, mostly memory and OS-level things.

I write about things I'm learning or debugging or trying to understand. Sometimes it's a paper I read, sometimes it's something I broke. Posts are rough and not always finished.
