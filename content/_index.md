# Hi, I'm Yazeed.

I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at Virginia Tech. I work on systems stuff, mostly memory and OS-level things.

This is where I write about things I'm learning or debugging or just thinking through. Sometimes it's a paper I read, sometimes it's something I broke and had to fix. I write to understand things better, and if it helps someone else that's a bonus.

Posts here are rough. I don't polish them much. Some are short, some are longer depending on how deep I went down the rabbit hole. You might find unfinished thoughts or things I'm still figuring out.

If you find something useful here, that’s great. And if you have questions or notice something unclear or even wrong, feel free to reach out.
