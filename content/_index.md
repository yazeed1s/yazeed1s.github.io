# Hi, I'm Yazeed.

I’m a Master’s student in Computer Science at Virginia Tech.

This site is where I write about things I’m working on, systems I’m trying to understand better, or things that interest me in general. Most posts start from a very practical question, sometimes a silly one. Something breaks. Something old or new catches my attention. Something feels more complex than it should be and so on.

A lot of what I care about sits close to the machine. Operating system internals, especially memory and storage. From time to time, I read about/look at Linux kernel subsystems when they feel relevant to what I’m trying to understand.

In terms of tools, I value simplicity and minimalism above all else, even in my personal life. That shows up in my choice of software, operating system, and programming languages.

How I explain things is fairly consistent. I start with a concrete problem or question, then follow it wherever it leads. Sometimes that path is messy or indirect.

This is not a tutorial site. It’s a working notebook. Some posts are incomplete. Some details are wrong. Some opinions will probably change.

If you find something useful here, that’s great. If not, it at least helped me think more clearly. And if you do find something wrong, feel free to reach out.
