# Hi, I'm Yazeed.

I’m a Master’s student in Computer Science at Virginia Tech.

This site is my systems notebook. I write about things I’m building, things I’m debugging, and systems I’m trying to understand well enough.

Most posts start the same way: something breaks, something feels off, or some design choice keeps showing up and I can’t stop thinking about it.

I mostly care about stuff close to the machine: operating systems, memory/storage, and whatever falls out of reading kernel code and papers.

You’ll find posts at different depths:

- Some are deep dives: the “here’s the mental model, the sharp edges, and where it breaks” kind.
- Some are surface notes: a single idea, a sketch, a quick clarification, or a useful fact I don’t want to forget.
- I keep the surface-level posts on purpose. If I waited until every topic was “deep dive ready,” I’d publish almost nothing.
  If you find something useful here, that’s great. If not, it at least helped me think more clearly. And if you do find something wrong, feel free to reach out.
