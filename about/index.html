Hey there! I’m Yazeed Alharthi, and welcome to my corner of the internet. I am a software developer with a Bachelor of Science in CS from Pittsburgh. I’m currently job-hunting and awaiting responses from a few graduate schools. This blog is all about my personal projects, discoveries, and interests. Here, I share new topics I&rsquo;ve learned, software development techniques, and cool demos.

I’m a fan of keeping things simple and customizable. I like tools that let me get under the hood and tweak things just how I want."><meta name=author content="Yazeed"><link rel=canonical href=https://yazeed1s.github.io/about/><meta name=google-site-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=yandex-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=msvalidate.01 content="XYZabc"><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.css rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://yazeed1s.github.io/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://yazeed1s.github.io/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://yazeed1s.github.io/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://yazeed1s.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://yazeed1s.github.io/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://yazeed1s.github.io/about/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://yazeed1s.github.io/about/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Yazeed's blog"><meta property="og:title" content="Yazeed's blog"><meta property="og:description" content="About Me Hey there!

I like tools that let me get under the hood and tweak things just how I want.\neditor I use Emacs as my primary text editor. It’s got everything I need like PDF tools, a built-in LSP client, a great built-in file manager, and smooth handling of shell commands. My Emacs setup is bare minimal; I stick to the defaults for buffer jumping, file switching, and code searching. Sometimes, I use VSCodium for quick tasks, so I juggle between the two.\nOS I favor Unix-based operating systems. I started with macOS, but a few years ago, I switched to Arch Linux. Arch’s philosophy and its solid package ecosystem won me over. The AUR and pacman are fantastic — I can confidently run pacman/yay -S [package name] and find what I’m looking for. I’ve got both an LTS kernel and a rolling kernel installed, and I can switch between them just in case one decides to misbehave (though that hasn’t happened yet). My system is lean and purpose-built — no bloated desktop environment. It’s just a text editor, browser, file manager, terminal, and a few tools for managing audio, WiFi, Bluetooth, and media. It’s simple, and I like it that way.\nWindow manager I’m still sticking with X11. I started with bspwm and used it for years, but a few months ago, I switched to my own window manager. It’s opinionated and fits my workflow perfectly.\nLanguages I like I love exploring different languages. I’ve written small to medium-sized projects in Rust, TS, Java, Zig, Haskell, C, C++, and Go but C and Go are my top picks. For me, C and Go stand out because they’re small and simple, and one can have a comprehensive understanding of them easily.

If I’m not tinkering with my OS or writing code, I’ll probably be out for a walk, catching up on a TV show (recommendations welcome!), reading a book, or playing chess (always up for a challenge), pool, or volleyball.
